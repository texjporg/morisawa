# morisawa

This package enables selection of 5 standard Japanese fonts
for pLaTeX + dvips.
The package was originally written by Haruhiko Okumura as part of
[jsclasses](https://github.com/texjporg/jsclasses) bundle,
and the TFM/VF files were previously distributed as part of
[ptex-fonts](https://github.com/texjporg/ptex-fonts) package.
Now all these files are distributed as a separate package,
maintained by Japanese TeX Development Community.

"Morisawa" is the name of Japanese font vendor,
but here we use only generic font names;
it means that there is no need for actual Morisawa fonts.
